# Uber-NCR-Bookings-Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride booking data for the National Capital Region (NCR) to identify demand patterns, cancellation drivers, operational delays, and revenue leakage.  
The objective is to convert raw booking data into actionable business insights that can improve ride completion rates, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

## 📂 Dataset
NCR Ride Bookings Dataset (Kaggle)  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatimkasem/ncr-ride-bookings-csv  

The dataset contains booking-level ride information, including:
- Booking status (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete)
- Waiting time metrics (VTAT & CTAT)
- Vehicle types and pickup/drop locations
- Ride distance and booking value
- Cancellation reasons
- Driver & customer ratings
- Payment methods

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Identify peak demand periods across NCR
- Understand drivers of ride cancellations and incomplete trips
- Measure operational delays using VTAT & CTAT
- Quantify revenue loss due to non-completed rides
- Highlight high-risk locations and vehicle types
- Recommend data-driven operational improvements

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions
- When does ride demand peak in NCR?
- What percentage of rides are completed vs cancelled or incomplete?
- Who cancels more — customers or drivers?
- How do waiting times affect ride outcomes?
- Where does revenue leakage occur?
- Which vehicle types and zones are operationally risky?

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Bookings  
- Ride Completion Rate  
- Cancellation Rate (Customer vs Driver)  
- Incomplete Ride Rate  
- Average VTAT & CTAT  
- Total Booking Value & Average Revenue per Ride  
- Average Driver & Customer Ratings  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Ride cancellations increase significantly with higher waiting times.
- Driver-side cancellations contribute more to ride failures than customer-side cancellations.
- Revenue loss is concentrated in specific pickup locations and vehicle categories.
- High-volume vehicle types show lower completion rates.
- Customer experience declines rapidly as CTAT increases.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Increase driver availability during peak demand hours.
- Pre-position drivers in high-VTAT zones to reduce delays.
- Improve ETA transparency and pickup accuracy.
- Prioritize high-value rides for faster driver matching.
- Focus optimization efforts on high-risk vehicle types and locations.
