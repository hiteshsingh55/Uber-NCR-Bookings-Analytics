🔍 Key Insights

Ride cancellations increase significantly with higher waiting times.

Driver-side cancellations contribute more to ride failures.

Revenue loss is concentrated in specific locations and vehicle types.

High-volume vehicle categories show lower completion rates.

Customer experience deteriorates rapidly with increased CTAT.

💡 Business Recommendations

Increase driver availability during peak demand hours.

Reduce VTAT through supply pre-positioning.

Improve pickup accuracy and ETA transparency.

Prioritize high-value rides for faster matching.

Focus optimization on high-risk zones and vehicle types.
